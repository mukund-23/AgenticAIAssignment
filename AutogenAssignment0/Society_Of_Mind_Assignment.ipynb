      "**Recommended Loan Amount: ₹0**\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Risk Assessment and Rationale**\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary and overriding risk factor is that **all applicant data is unverified**.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the applicant's stated financial profile appears strong on the surface (high income, good credit score, low requested amount relative to income), no prudent financial institution can extend a loan based on unverified claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Unquantifiable Default Risk:** Without verification, the income, existing debts, and even the credit score cannot be trusted. The actual financial situation could be drastically different from what is presented, making it impossible to accurately assess the applicant's ability to repay the loan.\n",
      "*   **High Fraud Risk:** Processing a loan on unverified information exposes the lender to a significant risk of fraud. The identity of the applicant and the authenticity of their financial documents must be confirmed through a mandatory KYC (Know Your Customer) process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conditions for Re-evaluation**\n",
      "\n",
      "The application can be re-evaluated for the requested amount of **₹3 Lakh** upon the successful verification of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Income Verification:** Submission and verification of salary slips, bank statements, and Income Tax Returns (ITR) for the last 2-3 years.\n",
      "2.  **Identity and Address Verification:** Completion of the KYC process using valid government-issued documents (e.g., PAN Card, Aadhaar Card).\n",
      "3.  **Credit and Debt Verification:** A formal credit report pull from a bureau (like CIBIL) to confirm the credit score and a comprehensive view of all existing debts and repayment history.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** Until all financial and personal details are formally verified, the application is not eligible for any loan amount.\n",
      "---------- TextMessage (human_supervisor_agent) ----------\n",
      "APPROVE\n",
      "---------- TextMessage (society_of_mind) ----------\n",
      "### **Final Decision: APPROVED**\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Facts**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Applicant:** Unverified\n",
      "*   **Annual Income:** ₹20 Lakh (Unverified)\n",
      "*   **Existing Debts:** ₹3 Lakh (Unverified)\n",
      "*   **Credit Score:** 720 (Unverified)\n",

      "*   **Loan Purpose:** Business Expansion\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Reasoning & Agent Analysis**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Loan Collector Agent Input:**\n",
      "The agent gathered the applicant's self-reported financial profile. A critical flag was raised: **Status: All provided data is currently unverified.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Risk Analyzer Agent Assessment:**\n",
      "The agent assessed the profile and concluded that while the stated figures appear strong, the unverified nature of the data represents an unquantifiably high default and fraud risk. The agent's formal assessment was that no loan should be considered until all financial details were verified through official channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Loan Amount Recommender Agent Recommendation:**\n",
      "Based on the Risk Analyzer's finding of extreme risk due to unverified data, the agent's recommendation was:\n",
      "*   **Recommended Loan Amount: ₹0**\n",
      "*   **Rationale:** A loan cannot be extended based on unverified claims.\n",
      "*   **Conditions for Re-evaluation:** The agent stipulated that the application could be reconsidered for the requested ₹3 Lakh upon successful verification of income (ITRs, bank statements), identity (KYC), and credit/debt (formal credit bureau report).\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Human Supervisor Agent Final Decision:**\n",
      "Despite the unanimous recommendation from the automated agents to reject the loan (or approve ₹0) pending mandatory verification, the Human Supervisor has overridden the system's analysis and provided a final decision to **APPROVE** the loan.\n",
      "---------- TextMessage (loan_offer_generator_agent) ----------\n",
