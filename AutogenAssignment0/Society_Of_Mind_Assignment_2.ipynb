    "* Fact_Checker_Agent confirms the claim against any reliable news\n",
    "* Cross-Referencer agent confirms the work done by the fact checker\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Claim 1 (Existence of UPI Lite X):** **CORRECT.** UPI Lite X is a real feature developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

      "2.  **Claim 4 (Announced by RBI):** **CORRECT.** The introduction of UPI Lite X was announced by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on **September 6, 2023**, during the Global Fintech Fest.\n",
      "3.  **Claim 2 (Rolled out by Government of India):** **MISLEADING.** While the Government of India supports such initiatives, the direct implementing body for UPI is the **National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)**, under the regulatory guidance of the RBI. The rollout happens through individual banks and payment apps enabling the feature, not via a direct \"Government of India\" decree.\n",

The rollout date was July 1, 2024.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4.  The feature was announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Fact-Checking Analysis:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.  **Claim 1 (Existence of UPI Lite X):** **CORRECT.** UPI Lite X is a real feature developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Its key functionality is to allow offline transactions using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology through a stored value account on the device.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2.  **Claim 4 (Announced by RBI):** **CORRECT.** The introduction of UPI Lite X was announced by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on **September 6, 2023**, during the Global Fintech Fest.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3.  **Claim 2 (Rolled out by Government of India):** **MISLEADING.** While the Government of India supports such initiatives, the direct implementing body for UPI is the **National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)**, under the regulatory guidance of the RBI. The rollout happens through individual banks and payment apps enabling the feature, not via a direct \"Government of India\" decree.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4.  **Claim 3 (Rollout Date: July 1, 2024):** **INCORRECT.** There was no major, official, nation-wide rollout on July 1, 2024. The feature was announced in September 2023, and its implementation has been gradual. While some banks and apps may be piloting or enabling the feature for their users, this specific date is not associated with an official launch.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Conclusion:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe core claim about the existence of UPI Lite X for offline payments as announced by the RBI is true. However, the claim is factually incorrect regarding the rollout date and the specific entity responsible for the rollout.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Missing / Questionable Facts:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **Questionable Fact 1: The Rollout Date.** The claim specifies July 1, 2024, as the official rollout date. This is incorrect. The feature was announced in September 2023, and the rollout is an ongoing process by various banks, not a single event on this date.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **Questionable Fact 2: The Rolling-Out Entity.** The claim states the \"Government of India\" rolled out the feature. The more accurate entity is the NPCI, with partner banks enabling the functionality for their customers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'TextMessage\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'), TextMessage(id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'8a927d6d-bed1-4144-b0e6-d10512e413aa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', source=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'cross_ref\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=719, completion_tokens=386), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 11, 18, 15, 11, 725175, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Cross-referencing against trusted sources.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **Claim 1: A feature named \"UPI Lite X\" for offline payments exists.**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    *   **Check:** Cross-referencing against announcements from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and reports from major financial news outlets (e.g., The Economic Times, Mint) confirms the development and announcement of UPI Lite X for NFC-enabled offline payments.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    *   **Verdict:** **VERIFIED**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **Claim 2: It was officially rolled out by the Government of India.**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    *   **Check:** UPI and its features are products developed and managed by the NPCI, which is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
